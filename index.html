		  <p> Digital Eyes is a Windows Phone 7 application that assists the visually impaired in 
		  navigating inside buildings.  The application will interface with posted Microsoft Tags 
		  and guide the user to their specified destination inside of a building.  This destination 
		  includes common features of the building such as restrooms, or to a more specific location, 
		  such as the room number.</p>
		  <p>Our product is unique for several reasons.  Although GPS is included on almost every Smartphone, 
		  navigation within buildings is not currently supported well.  With Digital Eyes, we are combining indoor 
		  navigation using the Microsoft Tag technology and the phone's on-board accelerometer to create a more 
		  interactive experience for the user.  A user of our technology will be able to hear information about 
		  rooms and other points of interest within a building.  Our product also allows users to set restrictions 
		  on their navigation around the building, such as avoiding stairs.  Although Digital Eyes is directly targeted 
		  towards those with visual impairment, the application may be used by anyone that needs to find their way around 
		  an unfamiliar structure.</p>
		  <p>The experimental evaluation of our project will be performed by: 1) classmates who will use the system 
		  blindfolded, and 2) students on our campus, identified by the Office of Disability Services, who are among 
		  those in the target population of vision impaired students.</p>
